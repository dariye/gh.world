Improve ripples with language colors and dynamic sizing

- Rings now use language-specific colors matching commit points
- Added fade-out effect as rings expand
- Dynamic ring properties based on commit freshness:
  - maxR: 3-8 (fresher = larger)
  - propagationSpeed: 2-5 (fresher = faster)
  - repeatPeriod: 1000-2500ms (fresher = faster repeat)
