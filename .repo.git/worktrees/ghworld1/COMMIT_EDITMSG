Update terrain texture to hexed polygons style

Replace globe image texture with hexed polygon overlay that renders
countries as tessellated hexagonal cells. Uses GitHub contribution
graph color scheme (dark greens) for the land masses, creating a
contribution-squares aesthetic.

- Fetch countries GeoJSON from three-globe examples
- Add hexPolygons layer with resolution 3 and 0.4 margin
- Color hex cells using consistent hash of country name
- Keep dark globe image as ocean backdrop
