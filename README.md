# gh.world

Real-time 3D globe showing GitHub commits as they happen. Watch the world code.

**[gh.world](https://gh.world)**

## What it does

Shows public GitHub commits on a globe in real-time. Commits are plotted by contributor location and colored by programming language. You can filter by language, replay the last 6 hours, or just watch the world write code.

## Run it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dariye/gh.world.git
cd gh.world
npm install
npm run dev
```

You'll need a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) account. The CLI will walk you through setup.
